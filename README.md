# I estimate the lower limit for tha age of the Universe from data coming from one of the globular clusters of stars believed to be the oldest, the Messier 3 (M3) cluster.
The code file is the first one; the other are only data that I used for my analysis. These experimental data  were obtained in 2001 from a photometry of the globular cluster M3 con- ducted by Rey S.-C., Yoon S.-J., Lee Y.-W, Chaboyer B., Sarajedini A.
